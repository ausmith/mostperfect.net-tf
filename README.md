# mostperfect.net

I used to maintain a site + personal business under mostperfect.net. It began collecting dust
before I even finished college, and I have simply maintained the domain name. Apparently one
of the blog posts I made actually had cross-links on StackOverflow and other locations. As a
result, I am maintaining that one item in my S3 bucket deployed website.

## Terraform

Used to bring the site online easily while managing the config for the AWS resources.
